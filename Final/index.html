It includes user profile data such as the number of profile visits, user age, location, etc. When Dating apps like Tinder were becoming viral, people wanted to have the best profile in order to get more matches and more potential encounters.</p>

    <p class = "p2">I am wondering at what makes a profile on a dating app popular, and am going to compare the counts of profile visits and likes with some other factors, such as gender, age, and pictures the user put in her/his profile.</p>
