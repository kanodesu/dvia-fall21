     	<h4>This data visualization project aims to visualize one speech from State of the Union text corpus. I chose the oldest speech by George Washington in 1791.
     	It counts all the letters and the number of special symbols used, and sorts them from darker to lighter colors: 
     	the most used letters are the darkest, and the least used letters are the lightest.
     	By moving the mouse, the audience can see the transition from the original text to arranged letters by the order of alphabet.</h4>
