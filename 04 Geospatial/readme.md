## Documentation for Project 4
<br>
This data visualization project aims to visualize all the earthquakes happened on Earth on Nov.8 - 9 with the popup description of time, place and magnitude scale.
        <br>All the earthquakes are marked with the location marker, and I also made the Significant Earthquake which 
        had the biggest magnitude in a red circle. The yellow circles are all the earthquakes with a magnitude higher than 4.5.
        You can zoom in or zoom out to check all the locations, and click on all the circles to see the popups.

I used leaflet.js as my visualization method, and I watched some tutorial videos from [GIS and Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2X21GvWRIA) and [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZaZ2dB6pow). <br>I also get a lot of resources from the [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/index.html) website.
