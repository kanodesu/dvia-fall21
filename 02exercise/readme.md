## Documentation for Project 2



For this project, I am using the provided Air Quality data set from New York City's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and I need to choose a criteria for categorizing the data set. 
I decided to only looked at the PM2.5 air pollution in different neighbourhoods in NYC by calculating the mean value in recent years.

I started by sorting the data, and I need to calaulate the mean value for each neighbourhoods. I did this in excel, and exported it as [Sorted_Air_Quality.csv](https://github.com/kanodesu/dvia-fall21/blob/master/02exercise/data/Sorted_Air_Quality.csv).

After I got the sorted data, I decided to make a bar graph to show the relationship between PM2.5 Mean Value and different neighbourhoods, so the audience can know which neighbourhoods had higher PM2.5 values.

To start drawing the bar graph in d3.js, I watched some tutorial videos of d3.js on [Curran Kelleher](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSwd_9jyX4YtDYm9p9MxQqw) 's Youtube channel, especially these two, [Making a Bar Chart with D3.js and SVG [Reloaded]](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSwd_9jyX4YtDYm9p9MxQqw), and [Customizing Axes of a Bar Chart with D3.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3MCROTNN8g). 


My final output:
